Functional chemistry toolset for computational chemistry.  

Includes a Simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES) parser.

Includes a core library, a GraphQL server to serve web requests to access the core library functionality, and will eventually include generic machine learning suites using Apache Beam so it can run ML with Spark, Flink, Gearpump, etc.
